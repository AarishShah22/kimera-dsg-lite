<!-- # kimera-dsg-lite

The purpose of this github is to provide base code for users of Kimera-Semantics to have an elementary implementation of a Dynamic Scenes Graph. After running Kimera-Semantics, a voxel based file is generated that our code categorizes by semantic labels and then visualizes. Additionally, a demonstration is provided about how this DSG can be augmented with the usage of a Generative Preditive Text model for tasks such as a categorizing rooms based on detected features.
